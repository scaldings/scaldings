# Hello, my name is Luke.
I am a 14 year old intermediate Python developer.

## What I like:
I love coding in python for many reasons. Here are some:
  * Simple syntax
  * Ability to do a lot with just a few lines of code
  * Makes automization really easy  
  
I also like listening to music while coding. It helps me relax  
and (or) concentrate a lot.
I need to be organized all the time so I usually have most of my day written  
down somewhere so that I don't get lost in my thought - this kind of means I like  
being organized?
